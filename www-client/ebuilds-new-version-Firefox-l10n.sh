# The scripts needs to be run within www-client in the overlay; the repository
# must not have uncommitted changes.

# The script asks interactively for a few parameters:
# - list of languages (MOZ_LANGS in Firefox ebuild),
# - new version,
# - location of the Manifest for Firefox - used as the trick that allows to bump
#   the packages without downloading the language packs themselves, and adds
#   correctness to the process (if not security).
